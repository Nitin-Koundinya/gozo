## Features

- **Generic Utilities**: Simplify your code with reusable functions.
- **Functional Programming Primitives**: Use Option and Result types to handle errors gracefully.
- **Slice and Map Operations**: Perform common operations easily.
- **Modular Design**: Integrate with your existing projects effortlessly.

## Installation

To get started with Gozo, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Nitin-Koundinya/gozo/releases). After downloading, follow the instructions to execute the package.

## Usage

Using Gozo is straightforward. Import the package in your Go files and start utilizing its features. Below is a simple example to get you started:

```go
import "github.com/Nitin-Koundinya/gozo"

func main() {
    // Example usage of Gozo utilities
}
```

## Components

### Slices

Gozo provides a set of utilities to manipulate slices effectively. You can filter, map, and reduce slices with ease.

#### Example

```go
s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
result := gozo.Filter(s, func(n int) bool {
    return n%2 == 0
})
fmt.Println(result) // Output: [2, 4]
```

### Maps

Working with maps can be simplified using Gozo. The toolkit includes functions to merge, filter, and transform maps.

#### Example

```go
m := map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2}
result := gozo.Map(m, func(k string, v int) (string, int) {
    return k, v * 2
})
fmt.Println(result) // Output: map[a:2 b:4]
```

### Functional Programming

Gozo embraces functional programming concepts. With the Option and Result types, you can handle values and errors more elegantly.

#### Example

```go
opt := gozo.Some(5)
result := opt.Map(func(v int) int {
    return v * 2
})
fmt.Println(result) // Output: Some(10)
```

## Examples
